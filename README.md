# 🚦 Real-Time Traffic Light Detection using OpenCV

This project detects *traffic lights* (Red, Yellow, Green) from *static images* and *videos* using *OpenCV* and *HSV color masking. Based on the detected color, the system displays the corresponding **action* (e.g., STOP, WAIT, START).

---

## 📌 Features

- 🎯 Detects traffic signal lights from both images and videos.
- 🎨 Uses HSV color space for accurate color detection.
- 🪞 Draws bounding boxes and displays action labels on detected lights.
- 🎬 Real-time video detection with keyboard exit.

## 🧪 Color Detection

Uses predefined HSV ranges for:
- 🔴 *Red* → STOP
- 🟡 *Yellow* → WAIT
- 🟢 *Green* → START

These ranges can be fine-tuned for different lighting conditions.
