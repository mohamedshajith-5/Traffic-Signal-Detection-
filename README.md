# ðŸš¦ Real-Time Traffic Light Detection using OpenCV

This project detects *traffic lights* (Red, Yellow, Green) from *static images* and *videos* using *OpenCV* and *HSV color masking. Based on the detected color, the system displays the corresponding **action* (e.g., STOP, WAIT, START).

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Detects traffic signal lights from both images and videos.
- ðŸŽ¨ Uses HSV color space for accurate color detection.
- ðŸªž Draws bounding boxes and displays action labels on detected lights.
- ðŸŽ¬ Real-time video detection with keyboard exit.

## ðŸ§ª Color Detection

Uses predefined HSV ranges for:
- ðŸ”´ *Red* â†’ STOP
- ðŸŸ¡ *Yellow* â†’ WAIT
- ðŸŸ¢ *Green* â†’ START

These ranges can be fine-tuned for different lighting conditions.
